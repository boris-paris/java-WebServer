/**
 * https://github.com/jrudolph/Pooling-web-server/blob/master/src/main/java/virtualvoid/net/NioPooledWebServer.java
 * 
 * Only modified to fit into the existing code.
 * 
 * Original comment:
 * 
 * A pooling web server using NIO and selection for keep-alive handling.
 * The main thread selects both on waiting for accepting new connections as well as for new data arriving
 * on old connections in which cases it schedules the connections for processing on the pool.
 * The main idea is that connections with keep-alive are handed back to the main thread after
 * processing one request. That frees the processing thread for other tasks.
 *
 * The complexities here arise from several problems with Java's NIO API. First, only the thread
 * holding the selector should operate on it. This means we have to monitor the threads from the
 * pool for finished but keep-alive connections and register them with the selector. Second,
 * there's a bug in NIO, which makes Selector.select return even if no channels are selected when
 * before a connection was closed in the wrong moment. The workaround is to cancel the selection
 * every time and reregister it with the selector.
 * (see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6403933)
 *
 * Third, we have to manage timeouts ourselves. We do this by running over the list of connections
 * each x seconds and check if the timestamp in the attachment is older than the configured timeout,
 * in which case the connection is closed.
